The Idle Institute (established in 2017) is a storytelling lab: a collective of
writers, filmmakers, sound-artists and engineers founded by [Sonia
Bernac](http://bernac.org) and [Eliot Allison](https://eliothenryallison.com).
Combining theories of the public sphere with quantum physics, they investigate
the potentialities of the story – seen as virtual matter and a precise political
tool. This emerges from the presumption of an unstable narrative field, in which
they examine unexpected couplings and clashes between narrative particles. The
Idle Institute’s projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in
urban space, phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations.
Currently developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their
research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and technologies
of storytelling.

They cheat occasionally, but only when it makes a good story...
